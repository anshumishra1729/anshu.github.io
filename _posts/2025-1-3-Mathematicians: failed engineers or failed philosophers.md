title: Mathematicians: failed
engineers or failed
philosophers?

Who of us would not be glad to lift theveil behind which the future lies hidden;to cast a glance at the next advances ofour science and at the secrets of itsdevelopment during future centuries?What particular goals will there betoward which the leading mathematicalspirits of coming generations will strive?What new methods and new facts in thewide and rich field of mathematical thought will the new centuries disclose? —David Hilbert,Paris 1900

These were the words from Hilbert’s famous lecture at the Paris International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), in which he proposed twenty-three problems to guide research in the dawning century. The standard wisdom is now that sciences undergo periodic ruptures so thorough that the
generations of scientists on either side of the break express themselves in mutually
incomprehensible languages. In the most familiar version of this thesis, outlined in T. S.
Kuhn’s Structure of Scientific Revolutions, the languages are called paradigms. Historians of
science have puzzled over the relevance of Kuhn’s framework to mathematics. We often see
how our ideas of biological phenomena have been changed during different timeline.
however we don’t see the change with mathematics, as the geometrical ideas of ancient
Indian and Greek are still stand true while. 

Writing in 1891, shortly before the
paradoxes in Cantor’s set theory
provoked a Foundations Crisis that took
several decades to sort out, Leopold
Kronecker insisted that “with the richer
development of a science the need arises
to alter its underlying concepts and
principles. In this respect mathematics is

no different from the natural sciences: new phenomena [neue Erscheinungen] overturn the
old hypotheses and put others in their place.” 

Nevertheless, one might suppose pure
mathematics to be relatively immune to
revolutionary paradigm shift because,
unlike the natural sciences, mathematics
is not about anything and, therefore,
does not really have to adjust to
accommodate new discoveries. Leaving
this mystery aside we must have to see
how mathematical studies were changed
when it freed itself from physical sciences
and philosophy. This “new situation”
involved both the incorporation of
mathematics within the structure of the
modern research university—the creation
of an international community of
professional mathematicians—and new
attitudes to the subject matter and
